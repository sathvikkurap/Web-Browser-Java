# Web-Browser This is a web browser in Java which stores a temporary memory of the sites you search in a file called _searched.txt_ (emptied when you close the application)! Made by watching a tutorial. 

This offers the capability to load most images, and keeps a log of the sites you searched, in the searched.txt file. 
 
# Setup and Instructions 

# Main method (also the easiest one)

Download the "WebBrowser.jar" file and run it.

# Other method 

You will need a Java IDE (such as Eclipse or NetBeans). Link for help:

# NetBeans:

To start change your default browser in your IDE to Chrome (or a different browser if you don't have that option, since usually those are better than the actual default IDE browser). Next, import all the files in the repository except the "WebBrowser.jar" file. Finally, run the program through "ReadFile.java". When you run the program, currently, you have to put a "http://" at the start of your search, and it should load! # After following one of these methods you should be good to go! Thanks for checking out my project, and it would be great if you could star this repository!
